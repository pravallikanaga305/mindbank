Graph Representation: An adjacency list is used to represent the graph. Each vertex in the list is a key in a map, and the value is a list of vertices to which the key vertex points.

Memoization: To prevent repeatedly calculating the longest path beginning at each vertex, we use a Map<Vertex, Integer> to store the result (memorization).

DFS with Memorization: The findLongestPath function iteratively determines the longest path by doing a DFS beginning at the specified vertex. If a vertex's path has already been determined, it can be obtained from the longestPathMap.

Base Case: The longest path originating from a vertex is 0 in the base case, which happens when a vertex has no outgoing edges.

The Test Cases' explanation

Single Vertex (testSingleVertex): Evaluates the situation in which there is just one vertex in the graph and no edges.

One directed edge connecting two vertices is all that is needed to test the scenario in which there are two connected vertices (testTwoConnectedVertices).

A basic linear path passing through three vertices is tested using the testThreeVerticesLinearPath function.

Several Routes (Examination)MultiplePaths): This function tests a graph by finding the longest path that leads to the same vertex among several pathways.

Tests the scenario in where a portion of the graph's vertices aren't connected to the initial vertex (disconnected Graph; testDisconnectedGraph).

Complex network (testComplexGraph): Examines a more intricate network with several pathways and vertices, some of which are not related to the start.

The No Edges Graph (testNoEdgesGraph) evaluates the situation in which a graph has several vertices but none at all.

Test a graph for numerous paths of the same length that lead to the target vertex using the numerous Longest Paths (testMultipleLongestPaths) function.

Does the solution work for larger graphs?
Because memoization greatly reduces the amount of duplicate calculations, the approach does indeed work for larger graphs.

Can you think of any optimizations?
Memorization has been used as the main optimization. Using topological sorting to make sure every vertex is handled just once is another possible optimization.

Whatâ€™s the computational complexity of your solution?
In terms of time complexity, O(V+E) 
The numbers V and E represent the number of vertices and edges, respectively. This is because there is only one processing of each vertex and edge.
As a result of the memoization map, the space complexity is O(V).

Are there any unusual cases that aren't handled?
The algorithm considers the graph to be a legitimate DAG. Since this technique is meant to operate on acyclic graphs, it would not function properly if the graph included cycles. Furthermore, it is predicated on the graph being connected from the initial vertex.
Graphs without any outgoing edges from the beginning vertex are examples of common edge situations that this effective approach can manage.
